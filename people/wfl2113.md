Hello, my name is Will Lounsbery-Scaife, and I am a first-year MA student in the department of 
biomedical informatics. I want to learn as much as I can about the applications of data science and 
machine learning in the biotech and  pharmaceutical industries. 

I am passionate about bringing climate change solutions to every industry, and I am interested in 
using bioinformatics and data science as tools to help us combat and prepare for climate change.
